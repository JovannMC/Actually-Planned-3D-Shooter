# Actually Planned 3D Shooter

This is the source code of a really old game I worked on.. yes that was actually the name while I developed it. The only [release](https://github.com/JovannMC/Actually-Planned-3D-Shooter/releases) of this repo contains all the development builds in a large archive and the latest build.

I guess I didn't.. **_plan_** for me to abandon it so quickly! hahaha- (i'm sorry)
